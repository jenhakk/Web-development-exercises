**This repository contains small projects and exercises for web development courses.**

## Imaginary baking site

This was the first larger web site I did before starting actual studies in school. It was done for an independent course for web development and it is created from scratch using HTML, CSS and little Javascript.

It was inspired by my previous profession as a confectioner.

## Exercise 4

This was an exercise in first year of studies. It was made to practice creating simple web pages by creating layouts, adding images etc.
