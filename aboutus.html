    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>What does FAQ mean?</b></dt><br>
        <dd>It stands for frequently-asked questions, and it’s a page on a website that gives quick answers to customer questions.<br> 
            The idea is to keep the answers short and direct so that people find info quickly. <br>
            We write it as “an FAQ”…(“an eff-ay-cue”) instead of “a FAQ” (a “fack”).</dd><br>

        <dt><b>What’s the benefit of an FAQ section on your website?</b></dt><br>  
        <dd><b>It saves you time.</b> If you spend a lot of your time answering emails or social media queries, <br>
            an FAQ can be a real timesaver. It can also help prevent costly and time-consuming returns in your online store.<br>
            <br><b>It brings new website traffic and new customers.</b> Google’s goal is to deliver answers to questions. <br>
            If you put your text in a Q&A format, you’re doing half the work already. Even better, <br>
            if you have a good answer to a question, you might get featured in one of Google’s answer boxes or feature snippets, <br>
            which will give you a big traffic boost.<br><br>
            <b>It builds trust and shows that you get it:</b> A well-written FAQ page shows experience. <br>
            You know what customers are thinking and you’ve already got an answer. <br>
            It’s a great way to increase the trust and professionalism of your website.</dd><br>

        <dt><b>How do you decide what questions to put in your FAQ?</b></dt><br>
        <dd><b>Look at your customers’ questions.</b> The first is pretty obvious: What do your customers ask you? <br>
            Look at your email inbox or social media account and see which questions keep popping up. <br>
            What usually makes people hesitate before purchasing? What doubts might they have? <br>
            The more you can automate the answers to these questions, these easier you’ll make it <br>
            for your customers to buy with confidence. And you’ll save yourself time too.</dd><br>

            <dd><b>Look at your competitors’ websites.</b> If you’re a new business or don’t have a lot of customer queries yet, <br>
                take a look at similar websites for ideas. Bonus points if you can answer the question better than they can.</dd><br>

            <dd><b>Look at Google and Quora.</b> Use Google’s Autosuggest feature to start typing <br>
                a question about your business into the search bar. You’ll see the commonly asked questions people search for. <br>
                This can be a jumping off point to figure out what questions to put on your own FAQ page. <br>
                Another idea is to browse Quora—a site built to answer people’s questions. Just type in a topic, <br>
                select More Options and then choose All Questions. <br>
                You’ll get a list of the most recent questions related to that topic.</dd><br>
