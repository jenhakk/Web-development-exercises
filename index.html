    </figure>

    <p>The genuine naan breads are traditionally baked in a very hot tandoor oven. <br>But since very few people have that at home,
        homebakers can use normal oven instead.</p>

        <h3><u>Naan bread</u></h3>

        <ul>
            <li><i>2 dl water</i></li><br>
            <li><i>2 dl turkish yoghurt</i></li><br>
            <li><i>1 bag of yeast</i></li><br>
            <li><i>1 tbsp honey</i></li><br>
            <li><i>1 tsp salt</i></li><br>
            <li><i>6-7 dl flour</i></li><br>
            <li><i>2 tbsp oil</i></li><br>
        </ul>

        <h4>On top:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li><i>water</i></li><br>
            <li><i>sesame seeds</i></li><br>
        </ul>

        <h4>After oven:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li><i>50 g melted butter</i></li><br>
            <li><i>3 pcs garlic cloves</i></li><br>
            <li><i>herbs, salt</i></li><br>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix the yeast with about 3 dl of flours. Add salt and honey with warm water (42 degrees).<br>
            Add the flours with yeast in to the water. Add room temperature yoghurt and keep adding the flours.</li><br>
            <li>Leave the dough rest under a cloth for at least 30 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Set the oven at 250 degrees.</li><br>
            <li>Add the oil in to the dough and keep kneading the dough. Divide the dough into 4 or 8 balls.<br> Flatten them with your hand and put them in to a baking tray. <br>Let them rest for 15 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Sprinkle water and seeds on top of the breads. Bake about 5 minutes in the middle section of the oven.</li><br>
            <li>Melt the butter and grate the garlic cloves with it. <br>You can also add fresh herbs in to the mix.</li><br>
            <li>Spread the breads with butter mix and <b>enjoy!</b></li><br>
        </ol>
